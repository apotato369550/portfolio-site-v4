    profile:
      - "Second-year CS student at USC, interning as a backend engineer — building systems for real operations and making sense of the data those systems produce. I've worked on production APIs, tools for family businesses, and analytics projects covering customer retention, financial decisions, and inventory planning. Currently leading GDGoc-USC and running a homelab on the side."
