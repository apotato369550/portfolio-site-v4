    profile:
      - "Second-year CS student at USC with hands-on experience building systems for real operations — from a production API at an AI software company to tools that replaced manual workflows in my family's businesses. I care about what actually runs, who depends on it, and whether it holds up. Currently leading GDGoc-USC and managing my own multi-node homelab."

    experience:
      - company: Evo Tech Software Solutions
        position: Backend Developer Intern
        start_date: 2025-09
        end_date: present
        location: Philippines
        highlights:
          - Designed and built a production FastAPI backend with 16 endpoints — structured around clean separation of concerns, async concurrent processing, and per-IP rate limiting to handle real traffic
          - Built reliability features into the API from day one — in-memory caching, retry logic, and a three-layer timeout system with graceful degradation so the service stays up even when upstream models don't respond
          - Engineered a video generation service with context-aware model selection, multi-duration support (15–60s), and persistent character state across scenes
          - Built image generation and document retrieval pipelines for ecommerce product analysis and internal search

      - company: Cebu Best Value Trading (CBVT)
        position: Systems Developer, Web Developer & Secretary
        start_date: 2024-01
        end_date: present
        location: Cebu City, Philippines
        highlights:
          - Built a full service management platform for the family HVAC business — digitizing the entire workflow from client service requests through quotation, technician assignment, and invoice generation, with role-based access for clients, workers, and managers
          - Built a kitchen management system to track raw materials, daily production output, and customer orders — replacing a paper-based process with a proper database, role-based access, and Excel/PDF export for daily operations
          - Built a quotation generator that uses OCR and AI to read my grandfather's handwritten supplier notes and output formatted digital quotations — eliminating a slow, error-prone manual step
          - Developed and maintain the company and family business websites; handle administrative tasks and documentation for the trading company

      - company: Google Developer Groups on Campus – USC (GDGoc-USC)
        position: Lead
        start_date: 2026-01
        end_date: present
        location: Cebu City, Philippines
        highlights:
          - Promoted from Data Science Officer (Aug 2025) to Lead (Jan 2026)
          - Organizing technical workshops, study jams, and community initiatives for USC CS/tech students

    education:
      - institution: University of San Carlos
        area: Computer Science
        degree: BS
        start_date: 2023-09
        end_date: 2027-06
        location: Cebu City, Philippines
        highlights:
          - 'Dean''s Lister — 2nd Semester, A.Y. 2024–2025'
          - DOST-SEI Merit Scholar (Since Jan 2024); DataCamp Scholar (Since Jan 2025)
          - AI and Data Lead, DOST START Program
          - Second Place, USC SHS-STEM 4th Research Congress (May 2023)
          - Graduated Senior High School with High Honors; Carolinian Academic Distinction (CAD) — all Grade 11 & 12 semesters

    projects:
      - name: homelab-manager — Infrastructure Automation
        start_date: 2025
        end_date: present
        highlights:
          - A Bash CLI for managing multiple homelab nodes — collects system specs, monitors real-time stats, and tests bandwidth across nodes via SSH, all from one place without manually connecting to each machine
          - Supports both interactive menu navigation and direct CLI args, so it works for human use and in automation scripts without modification

      - name: sysdawg — LLM-Powered Diagnostics Tool
        start_date: 2025
        end_date: present
        highlights:
          - Runs automatic system diagnostics (memory, disk, processes) across homelab nodes and sends them to a local Mistral 7B model for advisory analysis — returns troubleshooting guidance without ever executing commands autonomously
          - 'The "advisory-only" constraint was deliberate — a tool that can diagnose but not act is safe to run remotely, on shared machines, and in situations where autonomous execution would be a liability'

      - name: enrollmate — Course Conflict Solver
        start_date: 2025
        end_date: present
        highlights:
          - A full-stack tool that takes a student's course selections and finds all conflict-free schedule combinations using a backtracking constraint engine — the same class of problem as university timetabling, applied to individual registration
          - Next.js + Supabase frontend with PDF export; paired with a browser extension that scrapes course data directly from the university registration portal so students don't have to enter it manually

      - name: im-2-project — CBVT Service Management Platform
        start_date: 2024
        end_date: 2024
        highlights:
          - Full web platform built for the family HVAC trading company — handles the complete service lifecycle from client request to technician assignment to invoice, with JWT-authenticated role separation across client, worker, and manager views
          - PHP REST API backend with React frontend and MySQL — built as a course project that also happened to be a real client requirement
