    profile:
      - "Second-year CS student at USC, currently interning as an AI engineer building Python backends, ecommerce analysis pipelines, and video generation services. I think in systems and constraints — what's fixed, what's flexible, what breaks. Leading GDGoc-USC, running a homelab, and researching AI memory architectures and university timetabling on the side."

    experience:
      - company: Evo Tech Software Solutions
        position: AI Engineer Intern
        start_date: 2025-09

        location: Philippines
        highlights:
          - Built a FastAPI backend with 16 endpoints for AI-powered Amazon listing analysis — a two-phase pipeline that analyzes each image individually then synthesizes insights across the full listing using GPT-4 Vision
          - Engineered a video generation service using Sora 2 and Sora 2 Pro with persistent character identities across scenes, multi-duration support (15–60s), and context-aware model selection based on content type (UGC vs. showcase)
          - Built production-grade features into the API - async concurrent processing, per-IP rate limiting, in-memory caching, retry logic, and a three-layer timeout system with graceful degradation
          - Built image generation pipelines with Nano Banana Pro for ecommerce product visualization and designed RAG pipelines for internal document retrieval

        location: Cebu City, Philippines
        highlights:
          - Built a quotation generator that uses OCR and AI to read my grandfather's handwritten notes and output formatted digital quotations — replacing a manual, error-prone process
          - Built a kitchen management system to handle inventory, orders, and operations for a separate family business unit
          - Developing and maintaining the company website
          - Handle administrative tasks and documentation for the family trading company

    projects:
      - name: timetabling-algorithms — University Scheduling Research
        start_date: 2025
        end_date: present
        highlights:
          - A research framework for solving the very real problem of scheduling university courses without conflicts — treating it as a constraint problem where rooms, professors, and time slots all have to fit together
          - Compares a custom backtracking implementation against Google's OR-Tools CP-SAT solver to see where each approach wins and loses, tested on both real course data and synthetic problem sets

      - name: "jays-ai-agent-suite — Personal Agent Library"
        start_date: 2025
        end_date: present
        highlights:
          - A growing collection of specialized AI agents built while working with Claude Code — each one scoped to a specific job like architecture tracing, debugging, design review, or session archiving
          - Built to reflect how I actually work rather than how workflows are supposed to look, with clear role boundaries and explicit handoffs between agents

      - name: ai-yeast — LLM Memory System
        start_date: 2025
        end_date: present
        highlights:
          - A memory system for language models that gives them a sense of continuity across conversations — built on three layers (recent events, distilled facts, and core identity) with memories that strengthen through use and decay over time
          - Includes a RAG layer for document retrieval and reflection gates that validate outputs before updating memory, running on Mistral 7B via Ollama

      - name: Fake News Detection App
        start_date: 2024-01
        end_date: 2024-06
        highlights:
          - A classifier that scrapes news articles in real time and flags whether they're likely authentic or fabricated, built with TensorFlow
          - Combined web scraping, text preprocessing, and sentiment analysis into a single end-to-end pipeline
