## Who He Is

### Curiosity
> "I wouldn't be me if I weren't curious about everything. I'm fueled by a blend of curiosity, caffeine, and creativity. (Heavy on the caffeine part, tho). I love exploration."

### Scholarly
> "I combine my natural hunger for learning with precision and diligence. Whatever I endeavor to do, and in all that I learn, I do it thoroughly and I do it well."

### Passion
> "Some would say I'm a masochist at how I love putting myself through tough challenges. I see it as exercise (and I love exercise). Problem solving, critical thinking, building, analysis, architecture, anything that'll make my brain melt, I'm here for."

## Aesthetic

Vaporwave. Not as a gimmick — as identity. Purple/pink/cyan gradients, neon glow, 3D grid, floating geometry, glass morphism. The site *looks* like how he thinks: retro-futurist, layered, alive.

## The Shape of Him

Curious by default. Precise when it matters. Loves hard problems the way some people love exercise — the difficulty is the point. Builds things. Studies things. Drinks too much caffeine. Keeps going anyway.
