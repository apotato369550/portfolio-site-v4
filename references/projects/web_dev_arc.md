# Web Dev Arc

The progression. Grade 7 creepypasta site to production full-stack apps. Reading this in order tells you more about how Jay learns than any resume does.

---

## Phase 1: Just HTML (Grade 7, ~2017)

### pasta-pot — Creepypasta Showcase Site
**What:** Static site displaying horror stories. First contact with HTML and CSS.
**Tech:** HTML, CSS.
**Note:** Named `pasta-pot`. Grade 7. The aesthetic instinct (vaporwave, horror) was already there.

---

## Phase 2: First Languages (~2021–2022, Senior High)

### simple-php-calculator
**What:** Web calculator in PHP. Self-described as first PHP project. Openly acknowledges potential bugs and security holes.
**Tech:** PHP, HTML.
**Note:** "First PHP project; acknowledges potential bugs and security issues." The self-awareness about security vulnerabilities was there from the start.

### all-purpose-calculator
**What:** Multi-purpose Math/Science calculator covering sequences, wave properties, magnetism, optics. Built in one week during vacation.
**Problem:** Classmates needed exam prep tools for finals.
**Tech:** PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
**Note:** Built to help classmates. The pattern of "I need this, my peers need this, let me build it" started early.

### simple-python-calculator
**What:** GUI calculator in Python using Tkinter. First Python GUI project.
**Tech:** Python, Tkinter.

### basic-login-system
**What:** Full account system — signup, login, logout, password recovery via email. Three database tables. PHPMailer integration.
**Problem:** Wanted to understand auth properly, not just the happy path.
**Tech:** PHP, MySQL, PHPMailer, HTML, CSS.
**Note:** This is ambitious for an early project. Full email recovery flow, 3-table schema design, production mail service. The scope instinct was already overreaching in the best way.

## Phase 3: Frameworks Begin (~2022–2023)

### first-bootstrap-website
**What:** Bootstrap 4 tutorial follow-along.
**Tech:** Bootstrap 4, HTML, CSS.

### first-laravel-project → laravel-login-system → laravel-breeze
**What:** PHP framework introduction. From blank Laravel project to scaffolded auth (Breeze) to custom login system.
**Tech:** PHP, Laravel.
**Note:** The pattern is always the same: intro project → build something with auth → understand the framework deeply.

### codigniter-sample-project → webdev2-exercise1-students → webdev2-exercise2-product-catalog
**What:** School (IM-1 / WebDev2) CodeIgniter 4 exercises. Student management system, then a product catalog with CRUD, validation, CSRF, flash messages.
**Tech:** CodeIgniter 4, PHP 8+, MySQL.
**Note:** `webdev2-exercise2-product-catalog` has the most thorough README of the school exercises — detailed MVC flow, form validation chain, migration steps. When he cared, the documentation showed it.

### webdev2-activity3-laravel-todo-list, webdev2-activity4-laravel-website, webdev2-activity5-login-page
**What:** Three Laravel school activities. Todo list, general website, login page.
**Tech:** Laravel, PHP, MySQL.

### my-mongodb-project
**What:** MongoDB learning project. Schema design, CRUD, Node.js integration.
**Tech:** MongoDB, Node.js.

## Phase 4: React Era (~2023–2024)

### first-react-counter-component
**What:** useState hook, single counter, re-render behavior.
**Tech:** React, JavaScript.
**Note:** One component. The entire point was understanding what state actually does.

### react-todo-list-app
**What:** Todo list following a YouTube tutorial, with modifications.
**Tech:** React, Create React App, JavaScript.
**Note:** "With modifications" — never pure tutorial-following. Always adapted.

### react-calculator
**What:** Calculator in React.
**Tech:** React, JavaScript.

### react-hooks-practice
**What:** Hook experimentation — beyond useState.
**Tech:** React, JavaScript.

### nextjs-todo-list
**What:** First Next.js project. Todo list as the canonical "learn the framework" vehicle.
**Tech:** Next.js, Node.js.

---

## Phase 5: Full-Stack (2024)

### web-dev-1-final-project — CBVT Company Website
**What:** Company website for Cebu Best Value Trading with user authentication and admin dashboard.
**Problem:** School final project that happened to be for real family business.
**Tech:** PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

### mimi-plus-webdev-2 — Points & Rewards System
**What:** Full-stack points and rewards management system with JWT auth.
**Problem:** School project requiring full auth + database + frontend.
**Tech:** React, Node.js, JWT, MySQL.

### taskmate-todo-list-firebase
**What:** Task management app using Firebase for real-time sync.
**Tech:** React, Firebase, Vite.
**Note:** The jump from local state to cloud-synced real-time data.

## Phase 6: Portfolio Iterations (2024–present)

### portfolio-site-draft
**What:** Draft pages, design exploration. Thinking in layouts before committing.
**Tech:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

### portfolio-site-v2
**What:** Full-stack portfolio. GitHub API, LeetCode API, DataCamp API all integrated. MongoDB for storage. Node.js server.
**Architecture:** External APIs → Node.js server → MongoDB → React frontend.
**Tech:** React, Vite, Node.js, MongoDB, GitHub API, LeetCode API, DataCamp API.
**Note:** v2 was the first time the portfolio became a system, not a page.

### portfolio-site-v3 (the vaporwave one)
**What:** Next.js portfolio with vaporwave aesthetic, Supabase PostgreSQL, cron jobs for API sync, Gmail contact form.
**Architecture:** External APIs → Next.js API routes → Supabase → frontend.
**Tech:** Next.js, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Supabase, GitHub API, LeetCode API, Gmail.
**Note:** v3 went full vaporwave. Purple/pink/cyan gradients, neon glow, glass morphism. It was beautiful and it was *him* — just the 2023 version. v4 is the restraint.

## The Arc in One Line

`pasta-pot (HTML, grade 7)` → `PHP + auth` → `Laravel + CodeIgniter` → `React hooks` → `Next.js + Supabase + TypeScript` → `production full-stack tools for real clients`.

Six years. No bootcamp. Entirely self-directed.
