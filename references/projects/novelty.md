# Novelty — The Early Era

The kid projects. The "I was 15 and learning" era. Not embarrassing — foundational. They show the instinct before the skill arrived.

---

## Games (The First Wave)

Games were the first serious motivation. Not calculators. Not "hello world." Games.

### 2048-game
Built to learn object-oriented Python. The game was the excuse. OOP class architecture was the point. Chose 2048 because it's simple enough to finish and interesting enough to care about.
**Tech:** Python, OOP.

### basic-snake-game
JavaScript and game physics via Snake. "Adapted from tutorial with custom modifications for deeper understanding" — never pure tutorial-following.
**Tech:** HTML, JavaScript.

### blob-shooter-game
JavaScript game mechanics exploration. Collision detection, interactive canvas.
**Tech:** JavaScript.

### first-2d-pygame
Python Pygame introduction. First foray into 2D game dev with Python.
**Tech:** Python, Pygame.

### simple-javascript-clicker-game
JavaScript fundamentals through a clicker mechanic. Event handling, DOM manipulation.
**Tech:** JavaScript.

### minecraft-zombie-apocalypse-plugin-spigot
Built Christmas 2020. Java Spigot plugin adding a full zombie apocalypse survival mode: peaceful prep period (3 days), then permanent darkness, escalating mob waves across dimensions, win condition (defeat the end + return to overworld).

**README, verbatim:**
> "I had a lot of fun learning about Java and how to create plugins."

The mechanic design is actually solid — time-based progression, dimension-specific spawning, balanced difficulty ramp. This is game design thinking, not just Java practice.
**Tech:** Java, Spigot/Minecraft.

## First Everything

### first-tensorflow-program
The README is empty. The project exists. That's enough.
**Tech:** TensorFlow.

### first-bootstrap-website
Bootstrap 4 tutorial. First CSS framework.
**Tech:** Bootstrap 4, HTML, CSS.

### first-laravel-project
First PHP framework contact. The start of a Laravel arc.
**Tech:** Laravel, PHP.

### first-react-counter-component
One component. useState. The "why does this re-render?" moment.
**Tech:** React, JavaScript.

### first-contributions
The canonical open-source starter repo. Fork → clone → add name to list → PR.
**Note:** Not really a project — it's the ritual of making your first open source contribution. Everyone does it. Jay did it.
**Tech:** Git, GitHub.

### first-git-demo
One commit. One README. "I'll admit that it's a bit confusing, but I'm sure as hell learning."
**Tech:** Git.

## School Activities

### console-based-login-system
C++ login system for a school project. Self-described as "intentionally overengineered and buggy but functional." That combination — overreaching + honest about it — is characteristic.
**Tech:** C++.

### console-based-student-enroll
Java enrollment system. The README title says "SQL" but the project uses no SQL — it's in-memory Java data management. Jay notes this discrepancy himself.
**Tech:** Java.

### prog2-activities
Programming II coursework collection. Academic repository.

### webdev2-exercise1-students
CodeIgniter 4 student management system. MVC intro.
**Tech:** CodeIgniter 4, PHP 8+, MySQL.

### webdev2-exercise2-product-catalog
CodeIgniter 4 product catalog. CRUD, form validation, CSRF, flash messages. The most documented of the school exercises — when the project was interesting, the README showed it.
**Tech:** CodeIgniter 4, PHP 8+, MySQL.

### webdev2-activity3-laravel-todo-list
### webdev2-activity4-laravel-website
### webdev2-activity5-login-page
Three Laravel school activities in sequence. The pattern: todo list → general site → auth. Followed every time a new framework is introduced.

### arduino-res-project
DHT sensor + Arduino environmental sensing. School embedded systems intro.
**Tech:** Arduino, DHT library, C/C++.

## React Vite Boilerplates (The "I Made This in an Afternoon" Era)

These exist. They're functional. The READMEs are mostly just the Vite default.

- **my-password-generator** — Password generator in React/Vite
- **qr-code-generator** — QR code generator in React/Vite
- **my-weather-app** — Weather app in React/Vite
- **crypto-tracker-app** — Crypto price tracker in React/Vite
- **password-strength-checker** — Password strength checker in React/Vite

Each probably took 2-3 hours. Good for understanding API consumption and React component patterns. Not much more to say.

## Learning Exercises

### coding-problems-solution
Multi-language solutions to LeetCode/HackerRank/competitive programming problems. Personal archive.
**Note:** 90+ LeetCode problems solved, 5-star HackerRank Problem Solving badge. This repo is the evidence.

### my-algorithm-visualizer
React-based algorithm visualization. Step-by-step rendering of algorithm execution.
**Tech:** React, Vite, JavaScript.

### pathfinding-algorithm-visualizer
A* pathfinding on a grid with obstacles. Visual demo of search behavior.
**Tech:** Web (JavaScript/Canvas).

### super-simple-sortr
12 sorting algorithms visualized in Python. Includes BogoSort. (See `interesting_stuff.md` — this one got promoted.)

### frontend-mentor-qr-code-solution
Frontend Mentor challenge. QR code component, design-to-code, pixel-matching from JPG mockup.
**Tech:** HTML, CSS.

---

## Forks / Third-Party

These are in the GitHub but aren't Jay's code:

- **pandas** — Official pandas library fork. Probably cloned for learning/contributing.
- **sympy** — Official SymPy library fork. Same.
- **first-contributions** — The open-source onboarding ritual repo.
- **laravel-breeze** — Laravel's official auth scaffolding package.

## The Novelty Read

Taken together, the early era shows:
- Games first, calculators second — motivation was always "make something playable"
- Overreach was constant — the console-based login system was "overengineered" by his own admission. The all-purpose calculator was built in a week for finals. Always bigger than the assignment.
- Self-awareness from the start — "I'm sure as hell learning." "Acknowledges potential bugs." Never pretending competence that wasn't there yet.
- The pattern holds across everything: intro project → build with auth → understand deeply. Every framework, every language.
