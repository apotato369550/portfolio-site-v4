Hello! I've recently begun showing my family and friends my website and they're really impressed! So impressed. I'd love to tell you about how impressed they are at the job you and I have done synthesizing and coming up with this site, but there is work to be done.

1. The site is good, but it's too barebones and does not showcase a lot of what I have to offer
2. The way I've been showing people my site is to scan a QR code that redirects to the website. It's REALLY good conversation starter, and the fact that I managed to finish everything in 2 days and cram it all and to flex that a bit is pretty good hahaha
3. Could use more design work. I want to keep the aesthetic, while making it scream that "Hey! I know frontend too!"
4. I want to showcase the people I partner with and have their own sections. Kinda like the projects section, but geared towards organizations

Currently I'm reconciling how to mention websites of orgs I'm affiliated with, without making it look like I'm stealing all the work of the developers who actually made it. I had a hand in it, but not very big. Whenever people want websites done I tell them that I can do it, but it isn't my specialty, but that I also know people who are really good at it. Granted, all they really need is a static webpage so nothing too advanced really.

Stuff I wanna showcase: Affiliations (doubles as fullstack projects), Data Science and Machine Learning, AI, Internal Tooling, Academics and Experimentals 

I want this to be just a widget under projects - a window with tabs. Each tab is named after something I wanna showcase that acts like how Chrome or browser tabs work - but are single-page and constrained to the projects section. To switch, you scroll back up and hit the tab you wanna switch to and it switches and resizes accordingly
