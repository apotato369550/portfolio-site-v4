# INTENT: Narrative Reordering

## Core

Reorganize the section render order in `App.jsx` to follow the sequence: Narrative (Profile) → Credentials (Experience, Education, Scholarships) → Proof (Projects + absorbed sections).

## Goal

The current order is: Profile → Experience → Projects → Skills → Affiliations → Scholarships → Education. This is flat — it reads like a CV dump. The proposed flow gives the page a rhetorical arc: who I am, then what I've done, then evidence. Affiliations and Skills currently sit as standalone sections; this reordering forces a decision about where they land or whether they collapse into the Projects tab widget.

## Scope

### Files and Functions Touched

- `/home/jay/Desktop/Coding Stuff/portfolio-site-v4/src/App.jsx` (lines 17-25): Reorder the JSX section sequence inside `<main>`. Currently: `Profile → Experience → Projects → Skills → Affiliations → Scholarships → Education`. Target: `Profile → Experience → Education → Scholarships → Projects` (with Affiliations and Skills absorbed into Projects tab or removed as standalone sections).
- `/home/jay/Desktop/Coding Stuff/portfolio-site-v4/src/components/Skills.jsx`: Fate must be decided — does it stay as a standalone section, get absorbed into a Projects tab, or get dropped entirely? Currently imported and rendered in App.jsx.
- `/home/jay/Desktop/Coding Stuff/portfolio-site-v4/src/components/Affiliations.jsx`: Same question — currently standalone, candidate for absorption into Projects tab widget.

### Entry Point

`App.jsx` — the single render sequence for the whole page.

### Exit / Interface Change

Nav anchor links (if any exist in Header.jsx) and scroll behavior must stay consistent with whatever section IDs survive. Currently each section has a static `id` attribute (e.g., `id="projects"`, `id="affiliations"`). If sections merge, orphaned anchors break.

## Dependencies

### Hard Dependencies (Must land first)

- INTENT_projects_expansion: The reordering decision for Affiliations and Skills depends on whether the Projects tab absorbs them. You cannot commit to the App.jsx render order without knowing what tabs exist. If the tab widget lands first, reordering is a two-line change. If reordering lands first, Affiliations and Skills stay as-is temporarily.

### Soft Dependencies (Preferred order)

- INTENT_education_scholarships_layout: Education and Scholarships need to be adjacent in the render order. Reordering sets that adjacency, but the two-column layout itself is independent of render order.

### Independent

- Can run in parallel with: INTENT_education_scholarships_layout (the layout change doesn't require a specific render position)
- No code conflicts with: any Diagram component files

## Design Choices

### Non-Negotiable

- Profile stays first (it's the narrative anchor)
- Projects stays last (it's the proof)
- Experience must appear before Education in Credentials — professional before academic is the correct signal for this audience

### Negotiable

- **Skills fate**: Drop it entirely, fold it into a Projects tab, or keep as a standalone section below Credentials. Currently 5 skill categories exist in `content.js` (lines 90-126). No obvious home if tabs don't absorb it.
- **Affiliations fate**: Same question. 5 entries exist in `content.js` (lines 129-165). Candidate for a tab in the expanded Projects widget.
- **Experience ordering**: Should CBVT (family business, oldest) come after Evo Tech (current job), or is chronological reverse order correct? Current order in `content.js` is: Evo Tech → CBVT → GDGoc → DOST START. This is reverse-chronological. Correct for a CV but worth confirming intent.

## Open Questions

- Where do Skills and Affiliations land? Decision gates INTENT_projects_expansion tab structure.
- Does the nav header need anchor links to the new section groupings, or is it still just a name/contact block?

## Implementation Surface Area

- **Lines of code estimated to change**: 10-15 in App.jsx, 0-5 in Header.jsx if nav anchors exist
- **New files required**: No
- **Breaking changes to interfaces**: Only if anchor links exist that reference `id="affiliations"` or `id="skills"` — check Header.jsx
- **Risk level**: Low. Pure render order change with no logic. The only risk is orphaned anchor links or CSS that depends on section adjacency selectors.
