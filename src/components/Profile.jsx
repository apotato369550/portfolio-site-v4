        Started with a creepypasta site in Grade 7. Graduated to games, then auth systems, then
        full-stack apps, then production AI infrastructure. No bootcamp — just building things until
        they worked, then building harder things. Six years. Self-directed the whole way.

        Chinese-Filipino, born in Cebu. My family runs businesses. I'm the person they call when
        something needs software. Most of what I build ends up running on real operations for real
        people — not demos.
