        My first exposure to programming was when I was 9 and I read "Teach Yourself C" by Charles Siegel. I didn't own a computer but I thought 'Hey, this is pretty cool!'. Graduated to making clicker games and 2d pong games in HTML. Building fullstack projects, exploring data science, learning about networking, and architecturing AI infrastructure.

        A lot of what I build is made to either scratch an curious itch, to learn, or because it's my job. In any case, I do it with glee.
